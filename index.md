This is a personal page, designed to mostly, although not exclusively, fill the role of an extended CV and act as a type of project repository. Currently clearly a work in progress. Some of the projects I worked on are described in greater or smaller detail [the projects category](https://pbkowalski.github.io/categories/#projects). One which is particularly interesting, unpublished elsewhere and owned exclusively by me is the 2018 VAST Use case study. Another project of interest is the NATO STO CMRE FORUM project.
