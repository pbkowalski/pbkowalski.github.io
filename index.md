This is a personal page, designed to mostly, although not exclusively, fill the role of an extended CV and act as a type of project repository. Currently clearly a work in progress. Currently only the [about me](https://pbkowalski.github.io/about/) page is finished. Some of the projects I worked on will be described in greater or smaller detail. One which is particularly interesting, unpublished elsewhere and owned exclusively by me is the 2018 VAST Use case study. While the post describing it is unfinished, there is a summary draft [pdf](assets\pdfs\VAST2018.pdf).
