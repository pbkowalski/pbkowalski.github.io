The VAST 2018 was one of the datasets I used during my PhD as a case study to showcase heterogeneous information fusion and the provenance techniques I had developed earlier. Some of these results were presented as a poster during the BELIEF/SMPS 2018 conference in Compiegne, France, but otherwise have not been published - I considered submitting this to FUSION 2019, but run out of travel budget due to other conferences. Furthermore I was starting my secondment at NATO STO CMRE at the time and would have been stretched thin. 




The IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics. The VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field by solving more complex problems. The dataset associated with a subset of the 2018 Challenge (Mini-Challenge 1) is used to demonstrate and showcase heterogeneous multi-source fusion, by using deep learning, machine learning, pattern-of-life analysis and traditional statistical methods to model knowledge and uncertainty in the framework of belief functions (also known as theory of evidence or Dempster-Shafer theory). The variables of interest are defined and the interrelationships between themselves and the contributing sources of evidence (belief assignments) are modelled using an informal graphical framework. The information sources are combined using appropriate combination rules and the provenance of belief is tracked using the graph model in conjunction with a contribution measure.
