The VAST 2018 was one of the datasets I used during my PhD as a case study to showcase heterogeneous information fusion and the provenance techniques I had developed earlier. Some of these results were presented as a poster during the BELIEF/SMPS 2018 conference in Compiegne, France, but otherwise have not been published - I considered submitting this to FUSION 2019, but run out of travel budget due to other conferences. Furthermore, I was starting my secondment at NATO STO CMRE at the time and would have been stretched thin. 

In hindsight, a lot of things could have been done beter in this model. The evidential modelling itself does not actually explicitly refer to valuation algebras or evidential network, as at the time I had relatively little grasp of that. It would be interesting to compare the results with a Markov Logic Network. Possibly an extension for another time

## Problem overview
In this case study we attempt to answer the questions stated in VAST mini-challenge 1 from 2018. The following is a shortened backstory from [VAST website](http://vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2018). All names and locations are fictional.

he IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge is an annual contest with the goal of advancing the field of visual analytics. The VAST Challenge problems provide researchers with realistic tasks and data sets for evaluating their software, as well as an opportunity to advance the field by solving more complex problems. In 2017, the VAST Challenge results suggested that the Kasios Furniture manufacturing company may have been a primary contributor to the apparent reduction of the number of nesting pairs of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit (RCBP). Kasios supposedly used the banned substance Methylosmolene in their manufacturing process. They dumped process waste in the northeast region of the Preserve and Methylosmolene was detected in their smokestack emissions. Kasios now claims that the analysis was flawed and biased. To back up this claim, they have provided a set of Pipit bird calls, recently recorded across the Preserve, with locations of where they were recorded. Another collection of bird calls from the preserve that has been vetted by various ornithology groups as having accurate identifications is provided along with corresponding geospatial information and a timestamp.

The problem to be answered is as follows:

1. Using the bird call collection and the map of the Wildlife Preserve, characterize the patterns of bird species over the time of collection (as per official problem statement). Here what we want to focus on in particular are two major questions - is the population of the RCBP waning? And is there a specific pattern in the behaviour of the RCBP which can be attributed to the location where Kasios is dumping the process waste?

2. Does the set of bird calls provided by Kasios support their claim that Pipits are being found across the Preserve? Here we are not concerned with the statistical impact of sample size of the test set, but rather try to answer the following questions: 
    * Are the locations where the pipits were recorded consistent with the patterns of life determined in (1)? 
    * Are the actual recordings provided by Kasios consistent with the RCBP recordings from the vetted dataset?

3. Formulate a hypothesis concerning the state of the RCBP and whether Kasios is responsible to it - whilst providing a clear track of evidence used to support the conclusion.


### Dataset overview
The dataset consists of the following

* A map of the Wildlife Preserve and the location of the Kasios process waste dump site
* Library of 2082 bird recordings im mp3 format with varying lengths each with the corresponding metadata: label as call or song, label by bird type (including 187 RCBP labels), quality rating, X and Y coordinates of the location where the recording was taken and a timestamp
* 15 recordings labeled as RCBP provided by Kasios with X and Y location coordinates 

### Situation model


In order to model the situation we define the following variables:
* $L$ - Recording locations provided by Kasios are consistent with RCBP patterns of life
* $R$ - The recorded sounds (provided by Kasios) are typical for RCBP
* $K$ - Files provided by Kasios are legitimate
* $P$ - the population of RCBP is dwindling
* $D$ - the process waste dump site has an impact on RCBP behaviour 
* $F$ - Kasios is to be blamed for RCBP problems


We can define relations between these variables in natural language and then formally represent them using propositional logic

* The files provided by Kasios are legitimate if both the geographical locations are consistent with RCBP patterns of life and the recordings contain RCBP sounds $L \wedge R \rightarrow K$
* If the locations are inconsistent or the recordings do not contain RCBP sounds it implies that the Kasios files have been falsified $\bar{L} \vee \bar{R} \rightarrow \bar{K}$
* If Kasios files are legitimate the RCBP population is not dwindling $K \rightarrow \bar{P}$
* If the RCBP population is dwindling and RCBP patterns of life are affected by the dumping site Kasios is to be blamed for that $P \wedge D \rightarrow F$

$$E=mc^2$$


Finally we can define one additional relation  - note different arguments could be made using game theory
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{4}
	\item If Kasios files are deemed fraudulent it partially implies that Kasios is guilty (i.e. it provides some evidence $\delta$ towards that hypothesis). Here we model $\delta = 0.4$ and thus $ \bar{K} \xdashrightarrow {0.4} F$
\end{enumerate}
These relations are represented in graphical form in Figure \ref{SituationModel}.
